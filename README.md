# House Sales Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing house sales data and building predictive models using machine learning. It employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various regression techniques to predict house prices.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Alternatively, install them individually with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`housesales.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Train machine learning models using Scikit-Learn.
   - Evaluate model performance.

## Files
- `housesales.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing code and analysis.
